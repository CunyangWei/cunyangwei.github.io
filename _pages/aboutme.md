Hi! I am Cunyang Wei.

I received the masterâ€™s degree from the Institute of Computing Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2023. Also, I was a student at High Performance Computer Research Center in Institute of Computing Technology, where I did my research work. My main research interest is high performance computing, high performance deep learning systems, and heterogeneous computing. 

I am always willing to try all new things, and keeping to learn from them.
